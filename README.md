## 💡 Business Insights & Recommendations  
1. **High-Risk Segments**  
   - Month-to-month contract customers churn **3x more** than long-term contract holders.  
   - Customers using **electronic check payments** are significantly churn-prone.  

2. **Revenue Insights**  
   - Customers with **$90+ monthly charges** are high-risk. Loyalty discounts and bundled offers can reduce churn.  

3. **Customer Experience**  
   - **Fiber optic internet & technical support dissatisfaction** are major churn drivers. Improving service here could reduce churn substantially.  

4. **Retention Strategies**  
   - Incentivize long-term contracts.  
   - Promote auto-pay options.  
   - Launch targeted retention campaigns using churn probabilities.  

📌 **Impact:** Implementing these strategies could reduce churn by **15–20%**, improving revenue stability.
